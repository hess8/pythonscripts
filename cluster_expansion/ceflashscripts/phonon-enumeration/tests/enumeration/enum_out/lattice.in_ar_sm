# Concentrations
#
# - use specific concentration range (T/F)
# - use arrows on some of the atoms (T/F)
# The concentration ranges for each atom are specified by three
# integers, which define 2 fractions. The third number is the
# denominator for the fraction, the first two numbers are the
# numerator. The first two numbers need not be listed in ascending
# order.
#
# If displacement directions are to be used then a fourth number
# follows the fractions the fourth number should be a decimal that
# indicates the fractional amount of displaced atoms of that species.
