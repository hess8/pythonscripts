# phonon-enumeration tests

These output files are used to test the code. They have been generated
and verified using an independent MatLab code. To test future output
comment out and uncomment the appropriate lines in the
phonon_enumeration.py file. Namely the o10 for test 10, o21 for test
21 and so forth. You can then run a diff between the new output and
the old to veriyf the accuracy of the results.
